// Legacy input_interaction module removed.
// Explosion and Drag interactions have been deprecated and fully removed.
// Cluster pop tap handling now lives exclusively in interaction::cluster_pop.
//
// This file intentionally left as a stub so that any stale imports can be
// cleaned up incrementally without breaking the module tree. It can be deleted
// outright once all references to interaction::input::input_interaction are gone.
