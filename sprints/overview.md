# Color Fusion - Sprint Overview

## Project Vision
Transform the existing metaball rendering demos into a complete, minimalist arcade game following the "Bounce. Break. Breathe. Repeat." mantra. Each sprint delivers tangible value while building towards the north star architecture.

## Sprint Roadmap

### Foundation Phase (Sprints 1-3)
**Goal**: Establish core architecture and migrate existing code to modular crate structure

- **Sprint 1**: Core Architecture & Workspace Setup
- **Sprint 2**: Physics Foundation & Ball Behavior  
- **Sprint 3**: Rendering Pipeline Architecture

### Game Systems Phase (Sprints 4-7)
**Goal**: Build essential gameplay systems and mechanics

- **Sprint 4**: Game World Elements (Walls, Targets, Hazards)
- **Sprint 5**: Gameplay Loop & Win/Lose Conditions
- **Sprint 6**: Level System & Data Pipeline
- **Sprint 7**: Input System & Player Control

### Polish Phase (Sprints 8-10)
**Goal**: Enhance visual feedback and user experience

- **Sprint 8**: Background & Environmental Effects
- **Sprint 9**: UI/HUD & Game State Visualization
- **Sprint 10**: Effects, Particles & Visual Polish

### Integration Phase (Sprints 11-12)
**Goal**: Unify all systems and prepare for release

- **Sprint 11**: Full Game Integration & Testing
- **Sprint 12**: Platform Optimization & Release Prep

## Sprint Principles

1. **Feature-Focused**: Each sprint delivers a complete, testable feature
2. **Demo-Driven**: Every sprint includes a runnable demo validating the work
3. **Incremental Value**: Each sprint improves the playable experience
4. **Architecture-First**: Early sprints establish patterns for later work
5. **Refactor-Friendly**: Code organization supports continuous improvement

## Success Metrics Per Sprint

- ✅ Demo runs without crashes
- ✅ New feature is visually verifiable
- ✅ Code follows established patterns
- ✅ Tests pass (where applicable)
- ✅ Documentation updated
- ✅ No regression in existing features

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Rendering Performance**: Address early in Sprint 3
- **Physics Stability**: Validate in Sprint 2 with stress tests
- **Module Coupling**: Enforce boundaries from Sprint 1

### Schedule Risks
- **Scope Creep**: Each sprint has clear boundaries
- **Integration Issues**: Regular demos catch problems early
- **Platform Differences**: Test WASM build each sprint

## Dependencies

### External Crates (Locked Versions)
- `bevy = "0.16.1"` - Core engine
- `bevy_rapier2d` - Physics engine
- `leafwing-input-manager` - Input handling
- `serde` / `toml` - Configuration

### Development Tools
- Rust toolchain (stable)
- wasm-pack for web builds
- cargo-watch for hot reload

## Communication

### Sprint Artifacts
- Sprint plan (markdown file)
- Demo executable
- Changelog entries
- Test results

### Review Checkpoints
- Sprint start: Review plan and dependencies
- Mid-sprint: Demo current progress
- Sprint end: Validate deliverables

## Future Expansion Hooks

While maintaining MVP focus, each sprint considers future extensibility:

- Color mixing system (Sprint 4 prep)
- Paddle/player control (Sprint 7 foundation)
- Audio system (Sprint 9 hooks)
- Level editor (Sprint 6 data format)
- Multiplayer (Sprint 1 architecture)

## Sprint Velocity

Estimated sprint duration: 1-2 weeks each
Total timeline: 12-24 weeks to complete game

Adjust based on:
- Available development time
- Technical discoveries
- Playtesting feedback
- Performance requirements
