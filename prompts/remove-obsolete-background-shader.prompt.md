# Background World-Grid Removal (Completed Summary)

## Overview
The legacy fullscreen background rendering path (separate module + dedicated WGSL shader + plugin) has been fully removed. All background visuals are now generated internally inside the unified metaballs shader, reducing draw calls, simplifying mode management, and shrinking maintenance surface.

## Removed Artifacts
- Rust module (background material, quad component, plugin, resize system)
- World-grid WGSL shader asset (was previously embedded for WASM)
- Visibility / mode coupling logic that toggled a separate quad
- Mode variant that expected an external background pass

## Resulting Architecture
- A single metaballs shader implements all remaining background variants (solid, noise, gradient) directly.
- Background mode indices are now contiguous:  
  0 = SolidGray (neutral mid-gray)  
  1 = ProceduralNoise (twoâ€“octave value noise)  
  2 = VerticalGradient (y-based smooth gradient)  
- No external fullscreen quad entity is required; window clear color only serves as a fallback during initialization.
- Uniform struct size & alignment unchanged; only semantic meaning of the background mode field was reindexed.

## Benefits
1. One less draw call per frame (background quad removed).
2. Fewer systems (no resize / visibility toggling).
3. Faster cold-start (one shader fewer to compile).
4. Reduced cognitive overhead in mode cycling logic.
5. Centralized future background evolution (reactive effects can now be added in one place).

## Performance & Validation
- Frame time: Neutral-to-slight improvement (no extra pass).
- Native build: PASS
- WASM build: PASS
- Clippy (all targets, all features): PASS (no new warnings introduced)
- Visual parity: Existing background variants render identically or intentionally improved (slightly cleaner gradient banding due to unified gamma handling).
- No transparency path depends on an external quad; opaque backgrounds simplify compositing rules.

## Updated Success Criteria (All Met)
- No references to removed background components or shader path remain in active code.
- Deleted shader asset no longer present in repository.
- Background mode enum updated & contiguous; cycling stable.
- Unified shader unaffected in foreground behaviors; backgrounds render correctly.
- Builds & linting pass across native + wasm targets.
- Performance not degraded.
- Documentation and prompts no longer instruct usage of the removed external background pipeline.

All criteria: PASS

## Post-Removal Notes
- Transparent / overlay scenarios now rely on internal shader logic (any future semi-transparent background variant should remain inside the same pass).
- A comment near the uniform packing documents the active background mode index mapping for maintainability.
- Any prior instructions referencing the old world-grid path should now treat it as historical context only.

## Migration Guidance (If Reading Historical Commits)
If older configuration files or prompts reference the removed background path, update them to select one of the internal background modes directly. No API compatibility shims were retained because the removed variant was not serialized externally.

## Potential Future Enhancements
- Introduce additional procedural backgrounds (e.g., polar gradient, domain-warped noise) without adding a new render pass.
- Optional feature flag to exclude seldom-used background variants at compile time for shader size trimming.
- Consider renaming `background_mode` to `env_mode` if backgrounds expand to include lighting environment semantics.

## Rollback Strategy (If Ever Needed)
Reintroduce the removed shader & module from Git history in a single revert commit; re-add the background mode index and corresponding cycling logic. (No structural changes were made that would block such a restoration.)

## Completion Marker
This document supersedes the original action-oriented prompt and records the accomplished state after removal.
