# Compositor Test UI Feedback Fixes

## Summary
Addressed three feedback issues with the compositor_test UI implementation.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Removed Console Text Output
**Problem**: `info!()` log statements were appearing in the console, creating unwanted text output outside the UI interface.

**Solution**: Removed all `info!()` logging calls from:
- `ui.rs`: Removed logs from `setup_ui()` and all keyboard shortcuts in `handle_keyboard_shortcuts()`
- `forces.rs`: Removed logs from automatic and manual effect triggers
  - `update_burst_force_state()`
  - `update_wall_pulse_state()`
  - `handle_manual_effect_triggers()`

**Result**: Clean execution with no demo-specific console text. Only Bevy engine and scaffold system logs remain (which are outside our control).

### 2. ✅ Implemented FPS Smoothing
**Problem**: In release mode, the FPS counter was jumping around erratically, making it hard to read.

**Solution**: 
- Added `fps_smoothed: f32` field to `CompositorState` resource
- Implemented exponential moving average (EMA) in `update_fps_counter()`:
  ```rust
  let alpha = 0.1;
  state.fps_smoothed = alpha * state.fps + (1.0 - alpha) * state.fps_smoothed;
  ```
- Alpha value of 0.1 provides smoothing over approximately 10 frames
- UI now displays `fps_smoothed` instead of raw `fps` value

**Result**: Stable, readable FPS display that smoothly tracks performance without jitter.

### 3. ✅ Improved Layer Status Indicators
**Problem**: Layer status showed empty `[]` brackets which were confusing and didn't clearly indicate enabled/disabled state.

**Solution**: Changed layer status format from checkmarks to explicit `[ON ]/[OFF]` indicators:

**Before**:
```
  Background: ✓
  GameWorld: ✗
```

**After**:
```
  [ON ] Background
  [OFF] GameWorld
```

**Implementation Details**:
- Used string padding to align text (`"ON "` vs `"OFF"`)
- Format: `[status] LayerName` for better readability
- Clear visual distinction between enabled and disabled states

**Result**: Immediately clear layer status with unambiguous ON/OFF indicators.

## Files Modified

### `src/resources.rs`
- Added `fps_smoothed: f32` field to `CompositorState`
- Initialized `fps_smoothed` to `60.0` in `Default` implementation

### `src/ui.rs`
- Removed `info!()` call from `setup_ui()`
- Removed all `info!()` calls from `handle_keyboard_shortcuts()`
- Updated `update_ui_displays()` to:
  - Use `state.fps_smoothed` instead of `state.fps`
  - Display layer status with `[ON ]/[OFF]` format
- Updated `update_fps_counter()` to implement EMA smoothing

### `src/forces.rs`
- Removed `info!()` calls from:
  - `update_burst_force_state()` (automatic burst activation)
  - `update_wall_pulse_state()` (automatic pulse activation)
  - `handle_manual_effect_triggers()` (manual triggers)

## Testing Results

All changes verified with release build:
```bash
cargo run -p compositor_test --release
```

✅ No demo-specific console output
✅ Smooth, stable FPS display
✅ Clear layer indicators showing ON/OFF state
✅ All keyboard shortcuts working correctly
✅ UI updating in real-time
✅ No compilation errors or warnings (except pre-existing deprecations)

## Technical Notes

### FPS Smoothing Algorithm
The exponential moving average (EMA) formula:
```
smoothed_value = alpha * current_value + (1.0 - alpha) * previous_smoothed_value
```

- Alpha = 0.1 means 10% weight to new value, 90% to history
- Effective averaging window ≈ 1/alpha = 10 frames
- Balances responsiveness vs stability
- Can be tuned: lower alpha = smoother but slower response

### Layer Status Design Choice
Chose `[ON ]/[OFF]` over other options because:
- More explicit than symbols (✓/✗, ⬛/⬜, etc.)
- Works in all fonts/terminals
- Scannable at a glance
- Bracket format suggests "button state"
- Fixed width prevents text jumping

## Future Enhancements
- Consider adding colored text or background for layer status
- Potentially add FPS graph or sparkline
- Option to adjust FPS smoothing alpha via config
- Visual indicators for active effects in the scene
