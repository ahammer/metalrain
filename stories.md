Here’s a prioritized backlog of player-facing user stories (non-technical). Top = must-have for MVP; bottom = nice-to-have polish.

1. As a player, I can immediately see balls drifting toward a center so I understand the arena’s basic behavior. [DONE]
2. As a player, I can see balls of the same color stick together so I grasp clustering. [DONE]
3. As a player, I can pop a same-color cluster once it’s big enough so clearing feels obvious. [DONE]
4. As a player, I have a visible timer that resets on each pop so play never stalls.
5. As a player, I lose if I don’t cause a pop before the timer expires so there’s tension.
6. As a player, I win the level by clearing all balls so the goal is crystal clear.
7. As a player, I can tap a **Fan** to push balls in a direction so I can herd clusters.
8. As a player, I can toggle a **Magnet** to pull balls together so I can form larger clusters on purpose.
9. As a player, I can trigger a **Paddle** to smack balls so I can create high-speed collisions.
10. As a player, I can open/close a **Gate** to control flow so I can stage releases at the right moment.
11. As a player, I see clear visual/audio feedback when a pop happens so I know my action worked.
12. As a player, I earn points for pops and bigger clusters are worth more so waiting can pay off.
13. As a player, I build combo multipliers when pops chain quickly so timing and planning are rewarded.
14. As a player, I see on-screen indicators for active widgets (direction, range, duration) so I can predict outcomes.
15. As a player, I get a short, unskippable micro-tutorial in Level 1 that teaches “cluster → pop → reset timer” in 10 seconds.
16. As a player, I get one widget tutorial per early level (Fan, Magnet, Paddle, Gate) so I learn by doing.
17. As a player, I can restart a level instantly so I’m not punished for experimenting.
18. As a player, I can tap anywhere to pause and view a simple recap of goals and controls so I never feel lost.
19. As a player, I see clear “why you failed” messaging (e.g., “Timer expired”) so I know what to fix next attempt.
20. As a player, I can play with taps on mobile and with mouse on desktop so controls feel natural.
21. As a player, I get a simple 1–3 star rating at level end based on score and speed so there’s replay value.
22. As a player, I unlock the next level on a basic clear, but higher stars require better combos so mastery matters.
23. As a player, I encounter levels with different goals (clear all, reach score, survive X seconds) so the game stays fresh.
24. As a player, I meet new colors gradually so difficulty ramps without confusion.
25. As a player, I face increasing ball counts and spawn pacing so my skills are stress-tested.
26. As a player, I earn named **style bonuses** (e.g., Trick Shot, Bullseye) for clever pops so creativity is recognized.
27. As a player, I can enable a color-blind friendly palette so colors are distinguishable.
28. As a player, I can toggle haptics and sound so feedback matches my context.
29. As a player, I can preview a widget’s effect with a quick ghost indicator before committing so I can plan better.
30. As a player, I can play an **Endless Mode** once I unlock it so I can chase high scores beyond the campaign.
31. As a player, I see gentle dynamic tips after multiple failures on a level so I get a nudge without spoilers.
32. As a player, I can view a short replay of my best combo at level end so I can learn and feel rewarded.
33. As a player, I can trigger “panic” moments (e.g., temporary global repel pulse) via rare pickups so I have comeback options.
34. As a player, I encounter special puzzle twists (e.g., “don’t pop blue,” “make a size-10 cluster”) so strategy shifts.
35. As a player, I can use two widgets nearly simultaneously (multi-touch / rapid taps) so high-skill play is possible.
36. As a player, I can skim a minimalist level select map that hints which mechanic each level features so I can choose my practice.
37. As a player, I can see my personal bests and compare stars across levels so progress is trackable.
38. As a player, I can access a sandbox level with all widgets unlocked so I can experiment freely.
39. As a player, I can choose themes/skins for balls and arenas so visuals stay engaging.
40. As a player, I can read a concise “Advanced Tactics” page (combos, gating, ricochet setups) so I can level up my play.
