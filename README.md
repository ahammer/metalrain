# Ball Matcher / Bouncing Balls Sandbox

Modular Bevy 0.16 playground showcasing a clean plugin + RON configuration layout. Uses Rapier 2D physics for gravity and wall collisions. Spawns many colored balls that bounce within the window bounds.

## Features
- Modular plugin architecture (`camera`, `spawn`, `rapier_physics`, aggregated by `GamePlugin`)
- External `RON` configuration (`assets/config/game.ron`) for window, gravity, bounce, and spawn ranges
- Randomized radius, color, position, and initial velocity per ball
- Rapier 2D gravity + elastic wall collisions (configurable restitution)
- Debug physics overlay via `bevy_rapier2d` (enabled by default; can be disabled by removing `debug-render-2d` feature)
- Shared circle mesh reused by all entities
- Ready for extension into scenes / state machines

## Requirements
- Latest stable Rust (Bevy MSRV tracks latest stable)  
- Windows: Make sure you have the Microsoft C++ Build Tools / Visual Studio C++ workload installed.

## Run
```powershell
cargo run
```

## Configuration (RON)
Tweak values in `assets/config/game.ron`:
```ron
(
	window: (width: 1280.0, height: 720.0, title: "Bevy Bouncing Balls"),
	gravity: (y: -600.0),
	bounce: (restitution: 0.85),
	balls: (
		count: 150,
		radius_range: (min: 5.0, max: 25.0),
		x_range: (min: -576.0, max: 576.0),
		y_range: (min: -324.0, max: 324.0),
		vel_x_range: (min: -200.0, max: 200.0),
		vel_y_range: (min: -50.0, max: 350.0),
	),
)
```
Restart the app after edits (simple explicit reload for now). An asset-loader based hot reload could be added later.

## Code Structure
```
src/
	main.rs          # Minimal: load config, set window, add GamePlugin
	config.rs        # GameConfig + RON deserialization
	components.rs    # Components (Ball)
	camera.rs        # CameraPlugin
	spawn.rs         # BallSpawnPlugin (Startup spawning) + Rapier body/collider setup
	rapier_physics.rs# RapierPhysicsPlugin (gravity, dynamic resizing arena walls)
	game.rs          # Aggregates sub-plugins
assets/config/game.ron  # Runtime configuration
```

### Component Set
- `Ball` â€“ tag component (Rapier supplies `Velocity`, `RigidBody`, `Collider`, etc.)

### System Flow
1. Startup: `CameraPlugin` spawns camera; `BallSpawnPlugin` spawns balls with Rapier dynamic bodies & circle colliders; `RapierPhysicsPlugin` sets gravity & creates arena walls.
2. Update: Rapier steps simulation automatically; resize system rebuilds walls if window size changes.

## Coordinate System
(0,0) is window center. Bounds recomputed every frame from the primary window (so resize works).

## Performance / Build Notes
Bevy on Windows can hit the MSVC linker object limit when using the `dynamic_linking` feature. We removed it here after encountering LNK1189. If you want faster incremental builds and are not hitting the limit you can try enabling it again:
```toml
bevy = { version = "0.16", features = ["dynamic_linking"] }
```
If you see `LNK1189: library limit of 65535 objects exceeded`, remove that feature.

### Faster Compiles (Optional)
You can add to Cargo.toml profiles (already partially enabled):
```toml
[profile.dev]
opt-level = 1
```
Other common options (use if desired):
```toml
[profile.dev.package."*"]
opt-level = 0
```

### Release Build
```powershell
cargo run --release
```

## Possible Extensions / Next Steps
- Configure Rapier integration parameters (substeps, CCD) for high-speed stability
- Add per-ball mass / density variations
- Introduce game states / scenes (loading screen, menu, simulation)
- Ball spawning/despawning via input
- Asset-driven color palettes or texture mapping
- Hot-reload config via `AssetServer::watch_for_changes`
- Diagnostics overlay (FPS, entity count)
- Spatial partitioned queries for gameplay rules

## Collision Separation / Overlap Prevention
Real-time overlap mitigation is enabled via the `SeparationPlugin`, which listens to Rapier `CollisionEvent::Started` events (so only actual contacts are processed). On contact:

1. Compute target distance = (r1 + r2) * `overlap_slop`.
2. If centers are closer than target, compute overlap amount and push each body half the corrective distance along the normal (clamped by `max_push` and scaled by `push_strength`).
3. Optionally damp the velocity component along the normal by `velocity_dampen` (fraction removed).

Config block (in `assets/config/game.ron`):
```ron
separation: (
	enabled: true,
	overlap_slop: 0.98,     // <1.0: pre-emptive push before visible overlap; >1.0: allow a little penetration
	push_strength: 0.5,     // fraction of overlap resolved per contact event
	max_push: 10.0,         // positional correction clamp to avoid tunneling / jitter
	velocity_dampen: 0.2,   // 0..1 fraction of normal velocity removed (stability)
),
```

Tuning tips:
- Persistent overlap: lower `overlap_slop` (e.g. 0.95) or raise `push_strength`.
- Shaky / jittery motion: reduce `push_strength` or `max_push`, or increase `velocity_dampen` modestly.
- Balls sticking together: `velocity_dampen` may be too high; lower it.
- Performance (many contacts): system iterates only over collision events, so scale is roughly proportional to actual contacts, not O(n^2). If needed, batch multiple pushes or use accumulated contact manifolds.

Disable by setting `enabled: false` for A/B comparison vs pure Rapier response.
